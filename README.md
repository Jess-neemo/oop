Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 

Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, a Book, or even a Superhero!).
Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.


Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 

Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (such as 'move()'). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).
